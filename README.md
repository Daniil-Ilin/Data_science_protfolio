# Data_science_protfolio
This repository was created to showcase my portfolio to any potential employers.
Each subdirectory contains various projects done by me using my skills as a Data scientist. They are categorized according to the field of machine learning to which they belong. Most of them are based on various Kaggle competitions, but some are based on freeCodeCamp challenges, from the "Machine Learning with Python" course.
